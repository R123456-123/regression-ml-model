Regression supervised learning ML model.

Regression is a supervised learning technique used to predict a continuous numerical value based on one or more input features. It identifies relationships between variables to make accurate predictions.

There are two types of variables in regression:

Dependent Variable (Target): The value we want to predict (e.g., house price).

Independent Variables (Features): The inputs that affect the prediction (e.g., locality, number of rooms).

Regression is applied when the output variable is continuous, such as “salary” or “weight.” Various regression models exist, with linear regression being the simplest and most commonly used.
